Remember, these words are in their dictionary form. You might need to change them depending on how they are used in the sentence.

Now, let's tackle the first part of your sentence:  "Bears are at the door".

Think about each word:

Bears:  Look at your vocabulary table. What is the Spanish word for "bear"?  Since we are talking about more than one bear, what do you think you need to do to the Spanish word to make it plural?

are: This is a form of the verb "to be". Find "to be" in your vocabulary.  In Spanish, there are a couple of ways to say "to be", but for where something is located, we often use the verb "estar". Now, think about who is at the door â€“ the bears. Are they singular or plural?  You will need to use the correct form of "estar" for plural subjects (like "they").

at the door: Let's break this down further.

door: Find "door" in your vocabulary table. What is the Spanish word? "puerta".
the: "puerta" is a feminine noun. What is the Spanish word for "the" when it comes before a feminine noun like "puerta"? (Hint: It's a particle, so it's not in the vocabulary table, you need to recall your Spanish articles).
at: In Spanish, to say "at the" location, we often use the preposition "a" followed by the article. So, "a" + "the (feminine)" + "puerta". Can you combine "a" and the feminine "the" you just thought about?
Think about the order of words in Spanish. A possible structure for this first part could be:

[Noun (plural)] + [Form of "estar"] +  [a + Article] + [Noun]

Give it a try! What do you think the first part of the sentence is in Spanish?
